Similar to Daniel and Titman (2006), composite equity issuance is defined as the growth rate in the market capitalization not attributable to the total stock return R: log(MCy/MCy−1) − R(y−1,y). For the portfolio formation at the end of June of year y, R(y−1,y) is the cumulative log return (calculated via the total return index, Datastream item RI) from June of year y − 1 to June of year y and MCy is the market capitalization (Datastream item MV) from June of year y. Equity issuance such as stock issues, stock option plans, and share-based compensations and acquisitions increase the composite equity issuance, whereas share repurchases or cash dividends reduce the composite equity issuance. We apply a one-year lookback window and also update this variable only each June to make it comparable to the yearly updated asset growth and net stock issuance variables.

Consider the result of Univariate sort and Fama-Macbeth regression, we propose a 6-factor model, including: Sigma_3, B/Mm, NOA, CEI, Log_MV, Alpha_3, RSI.

Consider the result of double sort, univariate sort, and Fama-Macbeth regression, we propose a 3-factor model, including: Log_MV, Alpha_3, RSI.
